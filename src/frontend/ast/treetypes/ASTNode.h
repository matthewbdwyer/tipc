/*! \brief Abstract base class for all AST nodes.
 *
 * ASTNodes define the elements of the program in a tree structured form.
 * A key concept to undestand is that of "ownership".   Every node in the
 * tree is "owned" by its parent.  The parent maintains a "shared pointer"
 * to each of its children.  This greatly simplifies memory management as
 * the tree can be reclaimed once its root is no longer needed.  It is 
 * important to understand that the "shared pointer" is only used to manage
 * the lifetime of the child nodes.  The values of those pointers can be
 * passed around freely to other parts of the compiler that want to view
 * the ASTNodes.
 *
 * Each node has information about the line and column in the source
 * program on which the element begins.  Subtypes define "<<" operator
 * that print a custom representation of the ASTNode, by overriding
 * the print method.
 *
 * There are two virtual methods that are used in a generic visitor
 * and for code generation pass.

   * methods.  The visitor parameter defines the operations that are
   * applied to each node that is visited; a subtype of ASTVisitor defines
   * those operations.
